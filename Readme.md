# EEG preprocessing/processing using MNE-Python

This project uses open-source EEG data collected on a Music Perception and Imagery task.

Music Imagery Information Retrieval: 10 subjects, 64 EEG Channels for a music imagery task of 12 different pieces w/ different meter, length and tempo

## Preprocessing

- [x] Install MNE-Python
- [x] Load the data into a Jupyter Notebook
- [x] Visualize raw signal
- [x] Independant Component Analysis (ICA)
- [x] Artifact rejection using ICA
- [x] Epoching (channel x condition x trial)


## Processing/Feature extraction
### 
- [ ] Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD) averaged by condition
- [ ] Steady-state-evoked-potential (SS-EP) for each song averaged across subject

- [ ] Hurst exponent averaged by condition for each channel
- [ ] 
- [ ] Beat per minute (BPM) for each song
- [ ] Fundamental frequency for each song

## Analyses

- [ ] Compare perceived vs. imagined conditions for each frequency band
- [ ]
